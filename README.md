redish
======

Redis simple tasks shell script.

Just for fun cos I could use redis-cli directly :P


TODO:
  1. Implement help.
  2. Redis does not support encryption but I can encrypt before storing and decrypt after reading, I guess.
  3. what else should be fun? maybe how to create like namespaces and list all keys related to a given namespace?
  4. what else? what else?
  5. write tests
  6. start | stop redis server from this utility
